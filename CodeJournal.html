    Today's Progress: Made progress on the JavaScript calculator.  I've been working on preventing multiple decimal points.
    Today, I was able to keep the fist decimal point to one.  Now I need to allow a first decimal point, and prevent 2 decimals
    after the operator.  At the moment I can either keep it to only 1 decimal, which isn't practical, or allow lots of decimals after
    the operator.  Getting closer though.   
    
  The code I added today was: 
  if(buttonValue === '.' && value.indexOf('.') > -1 && !value.includes('*' || '+' || '-' || '/')) {
    value = value.replace(/.++/, '')
  }
  
        if(buttonValue === '.' && value.indexOf('.') > -1 && value.includes('*' || '+' || '-' || '/') ) {
          console.log('Hey From Here')
          //value = value.replace(/.+++/, '')
  }

    Today's Progress: Finally got back to work on the Javascript calculator.  Just trying to find my way around.  May move on to another project, but I really want to pass these last 2 tests.    
                      The filter method seems like it would work.  But I need to work out how to only block decimals, instead of everything.  
  The code I added today was: value.filter(decimal => decimal.length < 1)

    Today's Progress: It's been a while.  I revisited the code and found that the first decimal was limited to one but not the decimal after the operator sign.  
    I also found that the RegEx I'm using is causing an error in the console.  I pass 14 of 16 tests if I just take out the code I've been writing for
    the decimal point.  I still need to pass these two:
        11. When the decimal element is clicked, a "." should append to the currently displayed value; two "." in one number should not be accepted
        13. If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign.

    Today's Progress: I started on FCC NPM lessons today.  Cloned a repo from github, but needed a link to submit for the challenge.  
    I signed up with repl.it and made the change.  But that link is still failing the first test.  I'm going to move on to the second test.

    Today's Progress: I figured out that I needed to run repl.it for the link to work.  Makese sense.  
    I got through the first 2 NPM challenges, adding author and description to a package.json file.
