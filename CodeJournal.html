    Today's Progress: Made progress on the JavaScript calculator.  I've been working on preventing multiple decimal points.
    Today, I was able to keep the fist decimal point to one.  Now I need to allow a first decimal point, and prevent 2 decimals
    after the operator.  At the moment I can either keep it to only 1 decimal, which isn't practical, or allow lots of decimals after
    the operator.  Getting closer though.   
    
  The code I added today was: 
  if(buttonValue === '.' && value.indexOf('.') > -1 && !value.includes('*' || '+' || '-' || '/')) {
    value = value.replace(/.++/, '')
  }
  
        if(buttonValue === '.' && value.indexOf('.') > -1 && value.includes('*' || '+' || '-' || '/') ) {
          console.log('Hey From Here')
          //value = value.replace(/.+++/, '')
  }
