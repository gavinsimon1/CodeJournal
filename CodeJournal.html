    Today's Progress: Made progress on the JavaScript calculator.  I've been working on preventing multiple decimal points.
    Today, I was able to keep the fist decimal point to one.  Now I need to allow a first decimal point, and prevent 2 decimals
    after the operator.  At the moment I can either keep it to only 1 decimal, which isn't practical, or allow lots of decimals after
    the operator.  Getting closer though.   
    
  The code I added today was: 
  if(buttonValue === '.' && value.indexOf('.') > -1 && !value.includes('*' || '+' || '-' || '/')) {
    value = value.replace(/.++/, '')
  }
  
        if(buttonValue === '.' && value.indexOf('.') > -1 && value.includes('*' || '+' || '-' || '/') ) {
          console.log('Hey From Here')
          //value = value.replace(/.+++/, '')
  }

    Today's Progress: Finally got back to work on the Javascript calculator.  Just trying to find my way around.  May move on to another project, but I really want to pass these last 2 tests.    
                      The filter method seems like it would work.  But I need to work out how to only block decimals, instead of everything.  
  The code I added today was: value.filter(decimal => decimal.length < 1)

    Today's Progress: It's been a while.  I revisited the code and found that the first decimal was limited to one but not the decimal after the operator sign.  
    I also found that the RegEx I'm using is causing an error in the console.  I pass 14 of 16 tests if I just take out the code I've been writing for
    the decimal point.  I still need to pass these two:
        11. When the decimal element is clicked, a "." should append to the currently displayed value; two "." in one number should not be accepted
        13. If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign.

    Today's Progress: I started on FCC NPM lessons today.  Cloned a repo from github, but needed a link to submit for the challenge.  
    I signed up with repl.it and made the change.  But that link is still failing the first test.  I'm going to move on to the second test.

    Date: 10/21/2020
    Today's Progress: I figured out that I needed to run repl.it for the link to work.  Makese sense.  
    I got through the first 2 NPM challenges, adding author and description to a package.json file.

    Today's Progress: I breased through a couple of challenges before getting stuck on adding dependencies.  Working on finding the typo.

    Date: 10/23/2020
    Today's Progress: I solved that issue from yesterday pretty quickly this morning and knocked out a few more challenges.  
    Free Code Camp managed to make package.json files fun!

    Date: 10/28/2020
    Today's Progress: I'm trying to make sense of this new challenge using the .env file.  I've got a solution, but it's not passing the test.
    I'll need to do some more work to get through this one.

    Today's Progress: I'm working on pulling data from a new dot .env file into the app.  Still trying to wrap my brain around it.

    Today's Progress: This .env challenge is tough.  I think there is something simple I'm getting wrong.  I'm still trouble shooting.

    Today's Progress: I got through the .env challenge and the middleware challenge.  The problem was in my .env file.  I needed to drop the var and the spaces.
    Node is very picky.

    Date: 11/1/2020
    Today's Progress: I completed the Chain Middleware challenge today.  Changing the location of the middleware affects if it shows up.  
     
     /** 8) Chaining middleware. A Time server */
app.get("/now", (req, res, next) => {
  req.time = new Date().toString(); 
    next();
}, (req, res) => {
  res.send({
    time: req.time
    });

}

);

    Date: 11/2/2020
    Today's Progress: Repl.it wasn't working today.  So I switched over to a couple of SASS challenges.  It was harder to pass the first 2 tests than I expected, 
    but it was a good change of pace from Express.

    Today's Progress: Repl.it is working and I'm working on Get Route Parameter Input from the Client.  
     I haven't solved it yet but I'm working on it.

    Today's Progress: I'm working my way through Get Query Parameter Input from the Client now.  I'm still a bit confused by the last one, but hope to get a better grasp on things with this exercise.

    Today's Progress: Completed the 10th challenge: Get Query Parameter Input from the Client now.  It's making more sense but there is still a lot to learn.

    Date: 11/8/2020
    Today's Progress: The body parser challenge took me forever to solve.  It was actually easy to solve, but the directions aren't great.  It looks like a lot of people have had issues.
     The code needed was: 
          var bodyParser = require('body-parser'); 
          app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
          app.use(bodyParser.json());

 <p>
    Date: 11/9/2020
    Today's Progress: The final challenge was really tough.  
     app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
        app.post("/name",function(req,res){

        var name=req.body.first+" "+req.body.last;
        res.send({name:name});
})

app.get("/", function(req, res) {
res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + "/views/index.html"));
});

    Today's Progress: I worked on setting up Mongo DB and connecting it to Express today.  I'm not passing the 3rd test, "mongoose" should be connected to a database.
     So I still need to do some troubleshooting.

    Date: 11/11/2020
    Today's Progress: I spent an hour trying to connect to Mongo DB.  I'm getting an error in the console and still failing the 3rd test in FCC.  I did an ES6 challenge to get a win on the board.

 <p>
    Date: 11/12/2020
    Today's Progress: I did another ES6 destructuring challenge as a warm-up and then tried to get connected to MongoDB.  I ruled out a lot of possibilities, but I'm still not connected.

    Date: 11/13/2020
    Today's Progress: I created an ES6 promise.  I thought I had a breakthrough in MongoDB this morning but I'm still not connected.  Getting closer I think.
     
     const makeServerRequest = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {});

    Date: 11/14/2020
    Today's Progress: I passed another ES6 challenge, which was creating a module script.  It was good review.  I've been using this for a while, but didn't really 
     get that type has to be equal to module.  I tried to solve the connection issue with MongoDB, but I'm still getting an error.  I think it's an issue with my
     login credentials.  It's not that complex of a set-up, so I've basically tried everything to get it fixed.  I'll get it figured out, but it's going to take some more work.  
     
     Code: <script type="module" src="filename.js"></script>
